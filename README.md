Wine Quality Prediction

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! In this repository, we aim to predict the quality of wines based on various physicochemical features. This README will guide you through the project, explaining its purpose, structure, and how to run the code to make predictions.

Project Overview
In this project, we explore the world of wine quality prediction using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine the quality of a wine based on its physicochemical properties. This prediction can help winemakers and enthusiasts assess the quality of wines without extensive taste testing.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various physicochemical attributes of wines along with their associated quality ratings. You can find the dataset here. It's provided in CSV format and includes features like acidity levels, residual sugar, pH, alcohol content, and more.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd wine-quality-prediction
Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can now make predictions using the trained model.

Update the input_data.csv file with the physicochemical attributes of the wine(s) you want to predict the quality for.

Run the prediction script:

Copy code
python predict.py input_data.csv
This will provide you with the predicted quality ratings for the input wine data.

Model Training
If you're interested in retraining the model, follow these steps:

Prepare your training data. You can use the provided dataset or replace it with your own.

Open and modify the train.py script to preprocess your data and train the model using your preferred algorithm.

Run the training script:

Copy code
python train.py
After training, the script will save the trained model to the models directory.

Evaluation
We've included a Jupyter Notebook, evaluate.ipynb, that explains how we evaluate the model's performance using various metrics and visualizations.
